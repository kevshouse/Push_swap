To Do, 3rd June 2025

Based on the refactoring we've done, here's the complete list of source files for your push_swap project:

Source Files in src/ Directory:
execution_dispatcher.c

Operation dispatch and validation

Logging integration

Error handling

machine_init.c

Machine initialization

Argument parsing and validation

Stack creation

Logging setup

machine_free.c

Resource cleanup

Stack destruction

Logging teardown

log_utils.c

Logging system implementation

Log level management

File logging handling

stack_utils.c

Stack creation and manipulation

Number validation (ft_isvalidnum, ft_issafe)

Stack helper functions

operations_s.c

Swap operations:

do_sa()

do_sb()

do_ss()

operations_p.c

Push operations:

do_pa()

do_pb()

operations_r.c

Rotate operations:

do_ra()

do_rb()

do_rr()

operations_rr.c

Reverse rotate operations:

do_rra()

do_rrb()

do_rrr()

stack_inspection.c

Stack analysis functions:

machine_top_value()

machine_stack_size()

machine_is_sorted()

machine_verify_stack_links()

machine_print_stack()

Header File in include/ Directory:
machine.h

Type definitions (t_node, t_stack, t_machine)

Enum declarations (t_log_level, t_operation)

Function prototypes

Logging configuration
```bash
Typical Directory Structure:
push_swap/
├── include/
│   └── machine.h
├── libft/
│   ├── includes/
│   └── ... (libft implementation)
├── src/
│   ├── execution_dispatcher.c
│   ├── machine_init.c
│   ├── machine_free.c
│   ├── log_utils.c
│   ├── stack_utils.c
│   ├── operations_s.c
│   ├── operations_p.c
│   ├── operations_r.c
│   ├── operations_rr.c
│   └── stack_inspection.c
├── Makefile
└── main.c (your main push_swap file)
```
Key Characteristics:
Norm Compliance:

No file exceeds 5 functions

No switch statements

All functions under 25 lines

Proper header protection

Modular Design:

Operations grouped by type

Core functions separated from helpers

Logging system isolated

Validation separate from execution

Error Handling:

Null checks throughout

Safe memory management

Graceful degradation

Comprehensive logging

Logging System:

Configurable log levels

Multiple output destinations

Automatic file management

Error duplication to stderr

Stack Operations:

Complete set of push_swap operations

Pre-execution validation

Stack state safety checks

Consistent interface

This structure gives you a professional-grade implementation that:

Strictly adheres to 42 Norm requirements

Provides robust error handling

Includes valuable debugging capabilities

Maintains clean separation of concerns

Is easily extensible for algorithm development

Prevents common pitfalls like memory leaks

Offers detailed operational visibility

The file count might seem high (10 source files), but this is necessary to comply with the 5-function-per-file norm requirement while maintaining readable and maintainable code. Each file has a clear single responsibility, making the project easier to understand and modify.
